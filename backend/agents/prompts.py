   - Affected business areas or customer segments
   - Potential financial or operational impact
   
   Examples of alert-worthy scenarios:

2. **"tips" (string, 200-400 words)**
   
   Provide 3-5 strategic recommendations and forward-looking opportunities based on the intelligence. These should be proactive, strategic suggestions for management consideration.
   
   For each recommendation, address:

   - Business rationale and expected benefits
   - Implementation timeframe (Quick win vs. Medium-term vs. Long-term)

IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:
- Ground all alerts and tips in specific information from the consolidated briefing
- Prioritize based on business impact and immediacy, not noise level
- Assume executive audience: be crisp, specific, and action-oriented
- Connect dots across legal, political, and market domains where relevant
- If no critical alerts exist, provide honest assessment ("Current intelligence suggests stable competitive and regulatory environment; continue routine monitoring")
- Distinguish between certain developments vs. emerging trends requiring monitoring

Output format: Valid JSON with exactly two fields ("alerts" and "tips"), each containing a single string value.
